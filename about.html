        <blockquote>
            <p>Tyler is an exceptional product (UX) designer whose combination of craft, character, and collaboration has made him one of the most skilled and reliable people on my team for over seven years. His blend of technical acumen, visual design strength, UX and IxD expertise, and strong problem-solving skills enables him to work seamlessly with clients, product partners, and software engineering teams.</p>
            <p>Tyler thinks in systems, not just screens, and has designed and evolved design systems that scale across complex products. He is highly technical and comfortable discussing constraints and implementation details with engineers, consistently finding solutions that respect both user needs and technical realities. He is also a certified accessibility expert who not only designs accessible products but has helped craft accessibility learning paths and templates for others.</p>
            <p>On a personal level, Tyler is even-tempered, open to critique, growth-focused, and has a very strong work ethic. He is always willing to listen and do what is needed to get the job done. In short, Tyler is the kind of senior designer you can trust with high-stakes work and cross-functional collaboration, and he is an absolute pleasure to work with.</p>
