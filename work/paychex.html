            <p>While embedded with ITX, I worked closely with internal teams at Paychex to ship high-impact features for Paychex Flex and Partner Pro. I wasn't just designing screens—I was building systems, driving adoption, and improving workflows for both small business and enterprise clients. My work spanned performance, retention, scheduling, and cross-platform consistency, often bridging legacy systems and modern front-ends with flexible, accessible interfaces.</p>        
            <p><strong>Since the majority of my work is admin facing, I'm limited at what I can show visually.</strong></p>
        </header>

        <h2>Strategic Approach.</h2>
        <p><strong>Platform recognition and scale:</strong> Paychex Flex has earned multiple HR Tech Awards for core workforce technology, and the broader Paychex organization has been recognized by Newsweek and Ethisphere. Flex operates at enterprise scale, with 32 million monthly user sessions and strong growth in HR feature engagement.</p>
        <p>Paychex Flex supports a complex audience with equally complex tooling. Designing for this meant navigating overlapping domains—HR, benefits, finance, compliance—and building experiences that scaled across teams, device types, and third-party integrations.</p>
        <p>Projects were prioritized through a mix of customer feedback, legacy feature gaps, internal pain points, and platform strategy. Our early design tools included Sketch, InVision, and Zeplin. Over time, we transitioned fully to Figma for interface design, prototyping, and design system tokens.</p>

        <h3>Performance Reviews</h3>
        <p>I enhanced the existing wizard-style performance review tool by introducing grouped questions and weighted scoring. Beyond that, I added visibility into scoring and comments, improved how users tracked review completion, and introduced automated reminders. These refinements drove higher usage and stronger adoption by making the tool more insightful and less cumbersome for HR teams and employees alike.</p>
        <p>Performance management is supported within the broader Paychex Flex HR Analytics and Talent Dashboard ecosystem, which consolidates key workforce insights into a single place for decision-making.</p>

        <h3>Hiring</h3>
        <p>I led the initial design sprint and usability testing efforts to shape the vision and MVP for a new candidate management system. I delivered foundational prototypes and research artifacts before handing the project off to another designer to allow me to focus on higher-priority roadmap items. My early work laid the groundwork for scalable hiring workflows integrated with external job boards.</p>
        <p><strong>Three out of four clients (75%) reported shortening hiring cycles, saving an average of 26% time on hires.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3 million hires processed through Paychex Flex annually</strong></p>

        <h3>People Overview</h3>
        <p>I designed a modular dashboard system that adapts to each customer's Paychex setup. The People Overview pulls in data from across the Paychex ecosystem—attendance, timecards, benefits, retention signals, tasks—and displays it in a context-aware layout. The interface was built to be plug-and-play so customers only see what's relevant based on the applications they've purchased. It's flexible, scalable, and sets the stage for ongoing workforce insights.</p>
        <p>This work aligned with Paychex's Talent Dashboard strategy, which brings retention risk, time off balances, and performance ratings into one consolidated view to support a holistic understanding of employees.</p>

        <h3>Retention Insights</h3>
        <p>I named and helped design the Retention Insights feature, which identifies top talent at risk of leaving. Working hand-in-hand with Paychex data scientists, I helped translate complex metrics into a digestible risk score and supporting visuals. This meant asking hard questions about what makes a signal meaningful, determining when to surface risk, and how to present it in a way that leaders could act on confidently.</p>
        <p><strong>Built on 31 predictive risk factors</strong> and recognized as an <strong>Accounting Today Top New Product</strong>, Retention Insights helped clients <strong>reduce turnover by 15% to 20%</strong> compared to non-users.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This feature turned complex predictive signals into an experience leaders could act on quickly, supporting proactive retention decisions instead of reactive backfills.</p>

        <h3>State Taxes Walkthrough</h3>
        <p>I designed a responsive walkthrough that simplified state tax form setup and updates. This tool replaced a paper-based process and contributed to millions of dollars in annual savings by eliminating unnecessary mailings. I worked with a third-party API and QA teams to ensure the edge cases were covered and the mobile experience was just as smooth as desktop.</p>
        <p>This replaced paper-based tax setup with a guided, self-serve flow designed to reduce friction in compliance-critical workflows and minimize manual follow-ups.</p>

        <h3>Partner Pro</h3>
        <p>When I joined the Partner Pro project, the vision was already well underway. My role focused on refining and tokenizing the existing design system. I worked to enhance accessibility and interface clarity by tweaking the base library and bringing the patterns into alignment with evolving platform standards. While not white-labeled, this design system now supports a consistent internal experience across Partner Pro's suite of tools.</p>
        <p>Partner Pro is part of a platform consistently recognized by HR Tech Awards, NelsonHall NEAT leadership, and Sapient Insights UX satisfaction rankings.</p>

        <h3>Timecards & Pay Adjustments</h3>
        <p>My main contribution here was building out workflows that allowed users to copy, move, and set both standard and custom recurrences for time and pay entries. While I wasn't involved in the full redesign, these flows introduced meaningful efficiencies into a high-frequency task environment.</p>
        <p>These workflows support some of the <strong>highest-frequency actions in Paychex Flex</strong>, used daily by millions of employees and managers, where even small efficiency gains compound at scale.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Scheduling</h3>
        <p>Advanced Scheduling required more than a facelift. I helped rebuild the platform as part of a broader framework transition, ensuring parity with legacy scheduling tools while designing net-new functionality. I created a consistent system for copy, move, and repeat flows, aligned with what I had built in Timecards and Pay Adjustments. This system was designed to feel familiar across Time & Attendance tools while allowing flexibility for application-specific needs.</p>

        <h3>Clarify the Problem</h3>
        <p>Every project began with identifying who we were designing for, what legacy pain points existed, and how we'd define success from both a user and business perspective.</p>

        <h3>Explore Quickly</h3>
        <p>I used Figma to prototype at various levels of fidelity. When possible, we conducted usability tests early to validate flow logic, surface confusion, and uncover edge cases before moving forward.</p>

        <h3>Document & Iterate with Teams</h3>
        <p>I made sure devs, PMs, QA, and product owners were looped in from early mockups to final handoff. This included full documentation of states, flows, component specs, and contextual edge cases.</p>

        <h3>Design for Cohesion</h3>
        <p>I actively looked for ways to bridge experiences across the Flex and Partner Pro ecosystems, creating shared interaction patterns while leaving room for the necessary application-specific exceptions.</p>

    <!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
    <section>
        <h2>What I Learned.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing within a legacy system doesn't mean settling—it means identifying the right battles and solving real bottlenecks</li>
            <li>Early testing, even if quick and dirty, saves major headaches later in dev</li>
            <li>Consistency across products starts with reusable interaction models, not just matching visual styles</li>
            <li>You can deliver high-impact solutions even without access to hard metrics, if you listen, test, and iterate intentionally</li>
        </ul>
