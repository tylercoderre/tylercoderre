        <p>Redesigned a white-labeled healthcare provider search platform to make search context visible, adjustable, and trustworthy without breaking an existing material-based design system or white-label constraints.</p>
        <p>Key improvements included a contextual search system tying network, location, radius, and dependents directly to search and browsing, address-based location search to fix inaccurate results near geographic borders, and a new modular dialog system that enabled browsing, filtering, and adjustments without breaking user flow.</p>
        <p>Through iterative design, four rounds of usability testing, and close collaboration with engineering, the experience became easier to understand, faster to use, and significantly more confidence-inspiring. Users consistently completed tasks more quickly, noticed and adjusted search context without prompting, and reported higher trust in results.</p>

        <h2>Framing the Work.</h2>
        <p><strong>What This Was:</strong> An enterprise redesign of a white-labeled provider search platform where users infrequently search for care, often under stress, and need to trust results quickly.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The Core Move:</strong> I reframed the problem as <strong>context visibility</strong>. Network, location, radius, and dependents became first-class, visible, and adjustable inputs tied directly to searching and browsing.</p>

        <p><strong>How We Made Decisions:</strong> We combined qualitative usability findings with quantitative behavioral data. Pendo reports helped identify where users dropped off, where they backtracked, and which entry points were underused. We also reviewed conversion and funnel data to prioritize fixes that improved clarity without increasing friction.</p>

        <p><strong>Testing Cadence:</strong> We ran four rounds of usability testing and refinement. I co-moderated rotating sessions (trading on-and-off) so we could keep facilitation sharp, capture consistent notes, and iterate quickly between rounds.</p>

            <summary><strong>Key Outcomes.</strong></summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Users consistently noticed and understood search context without prompting.</li>
                <li>Adjustments to location, radius, and dependents became intuitive during browsing and results review.</li>
                <li>Task completion improved across primary workflows (search, browse categories, and refine results).</li>
                <li>Trust in results increased because the system explained itself.</li>

    <!-- FULL CASE STUDY -->
    <section>
        <h2>Overview.</h2>
        <p>This project focused on improving the usability, clarity, and flexibility of a white-labeled healthcare provider search platform used to find in-network care.</p>
        <p>Most users interacted with the product infrequently, often when starting a new health plan or searching for care under stressful circumstances. Many were unfamiliar with how healthcare networks, locations, dependents, and distance affected results.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the interface required users to manage multiple layers of invisible context while searching. The goal of this work was to make that context visible, understandable, and easy to change without disrupting an established design system or breaking white-label requirements.</p>
        <p>The result was a modular, accessible search experience that significantly improved discoverability, task success, and confidence in results.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Problem.</h3>
        <p>Usability testing revealed a consistent pattern. Users could complete searches, but they were often unsure whether the results were correct.</p>
        <p>On the homepage, users frequently overlooked which network, location, or dependent they were searching under. Those parameters existed, but they felt disconnected from the search input itself.</p>
        <p>Once users did notice them, they did not realize those selections applied globally to the search input, common searches, and featured categories. As a result, users treated those shortcuts as separate systems rather than filtered entry points into the same search experience.</p>
        <p>Browsing was also constrained. Only a handful of categories were visible on the homepage, and users could not browse all categories without performing a search first. If a user did not know what to search for, they were effectively blocked.</p>
        <p>After a search was completed, users could no longer change dependents from the results page. Adjusting required returning to the homepage, breaking flow and increasing frustration.</p>
        <p>Location controls added further confusion. Search radius was buried in filters, making it difficult to see what radius was active, how distance was calculated, or how to change it quickly.</p>
        <p>The system worked, but it did not explain itself.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Constraints.</h3>
        <p>This was not a greenfield redesign.</p>
        <p>The platform relied on an existing material-based component library. Major visual or structural changes were out of scope and budget.</p>
        <p>Because the product was white-labeled, the header needed to accommodate unpredictable branding. Some partners required extremely wide logos or multiple logos grouped together. Adding more controls to the header risked breaking layouts across clients.</p>
        <p>Any solution needed to improve clarity without introducing instability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Expanding Scope.</h3>
        <p>Midway through the project, address-based location search was added to the requirements.</p>
        <p>Previously, users could only enter a zip code, city, or state. Distance was calculated from the centroid of those areas, which produced inaccurate results for users near geographic borders. Users could live minutes from a provider and still see no nearby results.</p>
        <p>This surfaced a deeper issue. Because radius controls were buried, users had no way to understand why results looked wrong or how to fix them without trial and error.</p>
        <p>Address search alone was not enough. Location and distance needed to become first-class, visible elements of the experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Reframing the Problem.</h3>
        <p>The issue was not data quality or search performance. It was context visibility.</p>
        <p>Users needed to always understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What they were searching for</li>
            <li>Who the search applied to</li>
            <li>Where results were anchored</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When that context was visible and adjustable, confusion dropped immediately.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Approach.</h3>
        <p>I benchmarked healthcare and non-healthcare search experiences across mobile and desktop, focusing on how systems communicate state and scope.</p>
        <p>I explored modular wireframes that could scale across breakpoints while remaining compatible with the existing component library. These ranged from low-risk refinements to more progressive patterns designed for incremental rollout.</p>
        <p>I then developed multiple high-fidelity directions, intentionally spanning conservative through forward-looking solutions so stakeholders could evaluate tradeoffs concretely.</p>
        <p>To validate decisions, I co-moderated four rounds of usability testing with participants unfamiliar with the platform. This ensured fresh mental models and surfaced real confusion points.</p>
        </section>
        <section>

        <h3>The Solution.</h3>
        <h4>Contextual Search.</h4>
        <p>A new search component grouped all parameters with the search input itself. Network, location, radius, and dependents were visually and behaviorally connected, making it clear that all entry points shared the same rules.</p>
        <p>The component was responsive by design, adapting from a full-width desktop ribbon to stacked and single-column layouts for tablet and mobile. Dependents were accessible on all screen sizes.</p>
        <p>The logged-in hero pairs the new contextual search with clear state indicators, so users understand what they’re searching for, who it applies to, and where results are anchored at a glance.</p>

                        <p>The styling will change on the dialog depending on if it’s in it’s default overlay layout or fullscreen layout.</p>
                        <p><strong>Default.</strong> The default use will have the dialog overlay the page with a scrim and have rounded corners with a box shadow.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fullscreen.</strong> When in fullscreen, the dialog goes full-width and height, so there will not be rounded corners or box shadows since the dialog is intended to cover up all of the page content beneath it. This style is used on smaller mobile breakpoints.</p>

                        <p>Navigational inputs would navigate you to new pages or dialogs, as opposed to dropdown menus. This may be used in instances a dropdown doesn’t present enough functionality, such as the location selection when browsing by category.</p>

        <h4>Spacing and Sizing.</h4>
        <p>Spacing and sizing rules keep the dialog system consistent across screen sizes, making it easier to scan, easier to use, and easier to maintain. These specs document padding, type scale, touch targets, and alignment so every configuration stays readable and accessible.</p>

        <h4>Location and Radius.</h4>
        <p>Location dialogs clearly displayed the active radius and allowed immediate updates. Address autocomplete supported street address, city, state, and zip.</p>
        <p>Logged-out users were given sensible defaults to ensure results always had a location anchor. Logged-in users could save multiple addresses, supporting scenarios like searching near work, for dependents away at college, or for loved ones in other cities.</p>
        <p>The location dialog also followed a phased rollout to manage added complexity: first the new dialog system, then address support, and later recent search history and saved addresses.</p>
        <p>This view shows the location dialog with every available configuration turned on. The left image shows how content scrolls within the dialog, while the right shows all options visible at once.</p>

        <h4>Networks and Dependents.</h4>
        <p>Network selection gained search, visual scanning aids, pinned enrolled networks, and support for saving additional networks.</p>
        <p>Dependents were elevated to first-class entities. Dialogs supported search, clear labeling, tier indicators, and avatars, reducing errors and increasing confidence when searching for someone else.</p>
        <p>This network view contrasts the MVP and advanced configurations. The left shows the icon-only list with enrolled networks pinned to the top for logged-in users. The right adds provider logos and the ability to manage saved networks, including pinning plans for family members you support.</p>

        <p>Network dialogs supported logo images via the avatar component or icons next to networks, configurable to each provider’s preference. The imagery improved recognition and scanability, with search appearing conditionally for longer network lists.</p>

        <h4>Content and Discoverability.</h4>
        <p>Copy was rewritten to clarify functionality and relationships. Common searches and categories were aligned under a shared mental model. The “All categories” entry point was moved into context, eliminating the need to search simply to browse.</p>
        <p>Space reclaimed on the results page allowed dependents to be adjusted without leaving results.</p>

        <p>The categories dialog allows users to browse from high-level groupings down to niche services.

Long lists include search with alphabetical anchor links and grouping for faster navigation.</p>

        <section>
        <h4>Accessibility and Delivery.</h4>
        <p>Accessibility improvements were integrated from the start. New focus and active states were designed, including offset focus outlines for improved visibility. I collaborated directly with engineering, providing example code and detailed documentation covering states, spacing, color usage, and responsive behavior.</p>

        <h3>Leadership Notes And Tradeoffs.</h3>
        <p>This work balanced clarity improvements with enterprise constraints. The key tradeoff was resisting a header-first solution and instead making context visible where users actually make decisions: at the search input, while browsing, and while reviewing results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stability over novelty:</strong> extended existing components and states to reduce implementation risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive complexity:</strong> advanced features (saved addresses, recent searches, richer logos) were designed as optional configurations.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust as a feature:</strong> clarity and explainability were treated as product functionality, not polish.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Users consistently noticed and understood search context without prompting.</li>
            <li>Adjustments to location, radius, dependents, and networks became intuitive during browsing and results review.</li>
            <li>Task success improved from 33% (tracking baseline) to 100% in testing scenarios.</li>
            <li>Confidence in results increased because scope and state were visible and explainable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We paired qualitative testing insights with quantitative signals. Pendo reports helped us identify drop-off points, backtracking behavior, and underused entry points. Conversion and funnel data helped prioritize improvements that increased clarity without adding friction.</p>

        <p>Participants frequently commented that the redesigned experience felt clearer and easier than their own healthcare tools. The platform became more understandable, more flexible, and more trustworthy without disrupting existing systems.</p>
