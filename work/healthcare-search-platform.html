    <!-- ONE-MINUTE SKIM -->
    <section>
        <h2>One-Minute Skim Version (Hiring Managers)</h2>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Users rarely used this healthcare search tool and often arrived stressed or unfamiliar with how provider networks, locations, and dependents affected results. Critical search context was easy to miss, hard to change, and inconsistently applied across search, categories, and shortcuts.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Constraints</h3>
        <p>The product was white-labeled, relied on an existing material-based component library, and could not support major design overhauls or header changes due to unpredictable partner branding.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Work</h3>
        <p>I reframed the problem around context visibility rather than search quality. I designed a new contextual search system that tied all parameters together, introduced address-based location search, surfaced and simplified radius controls, and built a modular dialog system to support browsing, filtering, and adjustments without breaking flow.</p>
        <p>I validated the work across four rounds of usability testing with users unfamiliar with the platform.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Outcome</h3>
        <p>Search context became obvious instead of hidden. Browsing no longer required guesswork. Users completed tasks faster, adjusted parameters with confidence, and consistently trusted results. The platform became easier to understand without disrupting existing systems or branding.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- FULL CASE STUDY -->
    <section>
        <h2>Full Case Study (Primary Portfolio Version)</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This project focused on improving the usability, clarity, and flexibility of a white-labeled healthcare provider search platform used to find in-network care.</p>
        <p>Most users interacted with the product infrequently, often when starting a new health plan or searching for care under stressful circumstances. Many were unfamiliar with how healthcare networks, locations, dependents, and distance affected results.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the interface required users to manage multiple layers of invisible context while searching. The goal of this work was to make that context visible, understandable, and easy to change without disrupting an established design system or breaking white-label requirements.</p>
        <p>The result was a modular, accessible search experience that significantly improved discoverability, task success, and confidence in results.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Usability testing revealed a consistent pattern. Users could complete searches, but they were often unsure whether the results were correct.</p>
        <p>On the homepage, users frequently overlooked which network, location, or dependent they were searching under. Those parameters existed, but they felt disconnected from the search input itself.</p>
        <p>Once users did notice them, they did not realize those selections applied globally to the search input, common searches, and featured categories. As a result, users treated those shortcuts as separate systems rather than filtered entry points into the same search experience.</p>
        <p>Browsing was also constrained. Only a handful of categories were visible on the homepage, and users could not browse all categories without performing a search first. If a user did not know what to search for, they were effectively blocked.</p>
        <p>After a search was completed, users could no longer change dependents from the results page. Adjusting required returning to the homepage, breaking flow and increasing frustration.</p>
        <p>Location controls added further confusion. Search radius was buried in filters, making it difficult to see what radius was active, how distance was calculated, or how to change it quickly.</p>
        <p>The system worked, but it did not explain itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>This was not a greenfield redesign.</p>
        <p>The platform relied on an existing material-based component library. Major visual or structural changes were out of scope and budget.</p>
        <p>Because the product was white-labeled, the header needed to accommodate unpredictable branding. Some partners required extremely wide logos or multiple logos grouped together. Adding more controls to the header risked breaking layouts across clients.</p>
        <p>Any solution needed to improve clarity without introducing instability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Expanding Scope</h3>
        <p>Midway through the project, address-based location search was added to the requirements.</p>
        <p>Previously, users could only enter a zip code, city, or state. Distance was calculated from the centroid of those areas, which produced inaccurate results for users near geographic borders. Users could live minutes from a provider and still see no nearby results.</p>
        <p>This surfaced a deeper issue. Because radius controls were buried, users had no way to understand why results looked wrong or how to fix them without trial and error.</p>
        <p>Address search alone was not enough. Location and distance needed to become first-class, visible elements of the experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Reframing the Problem</h3>
        <p>The issue was not data quality or search performance. It was context visibility.</p>
        <p>Users needed to always understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What they were searching for</li>
            <li>Who the search applied to</li>
            <li>Where results were anchored</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When that context was visible and adjustable, confusion dropped immediately.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Approach</h3>
        <p>I benchmarked healthcare and non-healthcare search experiences across mobile and desktop, focusing on how systems communicate state and scope.</p>
        <p>I explored modular wireframes that could scale across breakpoints while remaining compatible with the existing component library. These ranged from low-risk refinements to more progressive patterns designed for incremental rollout.</p>
        <p>I then developed multiple high-fidelity directions, intentionally spanning conservative through forward-looking solutions so stakeholders could evaluate tradeoffs concretely.</p>
        <p>To validate decisions, I co-moderated four rounds of usability testing with participants unfamiliar with the platform. This ensured fresh mental models and surfaced real confusion points.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <h4>Contextual Search</h4>
        <p>A new search component grouped all parameters with the search input itself. Network, location, radius, and dependents were visually and behaviorally connected, making it clear that all entry points shared the same rules.</p>
        <p>The component was responsive by design, adapting from a full-width desktop ribbon to stacked and single-column layouts for tablet and mobile. Dependents were accessible on all screen sizes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Navigation Simplification</h4>
        <p>Rarely used settings were moved into the user profile menu. This reduced clutter, preserved space for unpredictable branding, and created room for future navigation without reworking the header.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Modular Dialog System</h4>
        <p>I designed and documented a modular dialog system that extended the existing design library to support more complex interactions.</p>
        <p>This system enabled category browsing directly from the homepage, with inline visibility into active network, location, and radius. Users could adjust parameters without losing their place.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Location and Radius</h4>
        <p>Location dialogs clearly displayed the active radius and allowed immediate updates. Address autocomplete supported street address, city, state, and zip.</p>
        <p>Logged-out users were given sensible defaults to ensure results always had a location anchor. Logged-in users could save multiple addresses, supporting scenarios like searching near work, for dependents away at college, or for loved ones in other cities.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Networks and Dependents</h4>
        <p>Network selection gained search, visual scanning aids, pinned enrolled networks, and support for saving additional networks.</p>
        <p>Dependents were elevated to first-class entities. Dialogs supported search, clear labeling, tier indicators, and avatars, reducing errors and increasing confidence when searching for someone else.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Content and Discoverability</h4>
        <p>Copy was rewritten to clarify functionality and relationships. Common searches and categories were aligned under a shared mental model. The “All categories” entry point was moved into context, eliminating the need to search simply to browse.</p>
        <p>Space reclaimed on the results page allowed dependents to be adjusted without leaving results.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Accessibility and Delivery</h4>
        <p>Accessibility improvements were integrated from the start. New focus and active states were designed, including offset focus outlines for improved visibility. I collaborated directly with engineering, providing example code and detailed documentation covering states, spacing, color usage, and responsive behavior.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3>Results and Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users consistently noticed and understood search context</li>
            <li>Adjustments to location, radius, and dependents became intuitive</li>
            <li>Task completion improved across all primary workflows</li>
            <li>Confidence in results increased significantly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participants frequently commented that the experience felt clearer and easier than their own healthcare tools.</p>
        <p>The platform became more understandable, more flexible, and more trustworthy without disrupting existing systems.</p>
