    <h2>Framing the Work for Mike Cardus.</h2>

    <p><strong>At A Glance:</strong> Helped evolve Mike’s positioning and digital presence during a business rename (from “Create-Learning” to “Organization Development by Mike Cardus”), then designed a story-and-results-forward website and his first product, <strong>SOLVED Cards</strong>, including packaging and an e-commerce-ready experience (development by the 19 IDEAS team).</p>

    <h2>Research, Rethink, and Refine.</h2>
    <p>The business previously operated under the name <strong>Create-Learning</strong>, which was unclear to prospective partners and did not support SEO and digital marketing. Based on competitive research and interviews, the direction shifted to <strong>Organization Development by Mike Cardus</strong> so the value proposition was explicit: you’re buying Mike’s expertise and perspective, not something generic or repurposed.</p>

    <h2>Brightening It Up.</h2>
    <p>Bold color and typography set the tone for the refreshed messaging. The visual system was designed to feel modern and confident, with enough vibrance to reflect Mike’s personality while still reading as credible and premium.</p>

    <h2>The Devil Is in the Details.</h2>
    <p>Mike’s work is custom and high-touch, so the collateral needed to reflect the same level of care. The stationery and business cards were treated like brand proof points, not an afterthought.</p>

    <h2>The Website.</h2>
    <p>The website was designed as a credibility-first marketing platform. It elevates outcomes, partnerships, and Mike’s content library above typical coaching sites, while guiding visitors toward clear next steps. The experience also set up a foundation for product marketing and selling <strong>SOLVED Cards</strong> online (built by the 19 IDEAS development team).</p>

    <h2>Homepage Pattern.</h2>
    <h3>Outcomes.</h3>
    <p>The homepage leads with Mike and his proof points so credibility is established immediately. Outcomes are treated as primary content, not a footer detail.</p>
    <h3>Services.</h3>
    <p>Services are structured for quick scanning and SEO clarity, making it easier to understand what Mike offers and how to engage.</p>
    <h3>Content.</h3>
    <p>A large content library was organized into a browseable, searchable structure so Mike’s expertise stays discoverable over time.</p>

    <h2>About Mike Cardus.</h2>
    <p>The About experience reinforces Mike’s approach and builds trust through process clarity. Clear calls to action encourage visitors to reach out once they understand what working with Mike looks like.</p>
    <h3>Organization Development.</h3>
    <p>Here is the Organization Development page which is one of the services Mike offers. In each service we detail the ROI in what you get right up front and to show breadth we detail all of the strategies that comprise each service. Lastly, we ensure prominent call to actions to get a hold of Mike.</p>

    <h2>Early Concepts.</h2>
    <p>Early exploration focused on bold, typography-led layouts that matched the new logo direction. Wireframes validated the core structure early, then high-fidelity iterations tested a few color scenarios (including heavier blue sections) before landing on the final balance of vibrance and readability.</p>

<section>
    <h2>SOLVED Cards.</h2>
    <p><strong>SOLVED Cards</strong> began as an idea from Mike: tangible prompts that extend problem-solving beyond a live session. We evolved the early concept (originally based on business cards) into a cohesive, brand-aligned product that works for individuals, peer-to-peer training, and group facilitation.</p>
    <p>A deck includes <strong>24 prompts</strong> that follow the stages of the <strong>S-O-L-V-E-D</strong> acronym, plus an instruction manual, “Contact Mike” cards, and blank note cards. The system was designed to feel premium through both the visual language and the physical materials, with careful attention to card stock and packaging.</p>

    </figure>
    <h3>E-Commerce as a Strategy.</h3>
    <p>A product isn’t a product unless you can buy it online. The site experience was designed to support product marketing and conversion, enabling Mike to distribute SOLVED Cards broadly through an e-commerce flow built by the development team.</p>

    <h2>Personal Touches Matter.</h2>
    <p>A brand as personal as this one wouldn’t feel right without custom photography. A photoshoot captured “The Mikeness” in action and helped the site feel human, confident, and real.</p>

</section>

<section>
    <h2>A Team Effort.</h2>
    <p>This engagement was a team effort at 19 IDEAS. The broader team developed core brand direction and messaging, and I carried that system through the website and product experience. 19 IDEAS also produced custom photography used across the site to capture Mike’s personality and how he works with clients.</p>
